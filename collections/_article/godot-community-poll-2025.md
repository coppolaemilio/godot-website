We want to learn more about the Godot community, understand who the users of the engine are, and find out how we can better support you. To achieve that, we have a short set of questions and hope you will take a few minutes to fill them out. The results will also help us guide our current and future items in the [priority list](https://godotengine.org/priorities/).

The poll is anonymous, and we will share the results publicly once submissions are closed. It will remain open for a week and should take only 5-10 minutes to complete.
