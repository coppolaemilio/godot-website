&lt;p>But without very extensive testing from the community, we can never be 100% sure that the release is ready to be published as a recommended stable upgrade for all users. With this candidate, Godot 4.4 is now ready for testing to upgrade existing projects (but always make a copy or version control commit before upgrading!), and we’re eager to hear how it fares and whether any new major issues have been left unnoticed until now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please, consider &lt;a href="#support">supporting the project financially&lt;/a>, if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors. Your donations go towards sponsoring their work and ensuring they can dedicate their undivided attention to the needs of the project.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We covered the most important highlights from Godot 4.4 in the previous &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-beta-1/">&lt;strong>4.4 beta 1 blog post&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, so if you haven’t read that one, have a look to be introduced to the main new features added in the 4.4 release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially if you’re testing 4.4 for the first time, you’ll want to get a condensed overview of what new features you might want to make use of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This section covers changes made since the previous &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-beta-4/">beta 4 snapshot&lt;/a>, which are mostly regression fixes, or “safe” fixes to longstanding issues:&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="changelog">Changelog&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As we released 4.4 beta 4 just days ago, and tightened a lot our policy on what kind of changes can be merged leading to the release candidate stage, there aren’t a lot of changes in this snapshot. &lt;strong>12 contributors&lt;/strong> (at this stage, release heroes!) submitted &lt;strong>18 fixes&lt;/strong> for this release. See our &lt;a href="https://godotengine.github.io/godot-interactive-changelog/#4.4-rc1">&lt;strong>interactive changelog&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> for the complete list of changes since the 4.4-beta4 snapshot. You can also review &lt;a href="https://godotengine.github.io/godot-interactive-changelog/#4.4">all changes included in 4.4&lt;/a> compared to the previous 4.3 feature release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This release is built from commit &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/8ed125b42908d0d46d3b8967e3a3bc03f809b3af">&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8ed125b42&lt;/code>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

While engine maintainers try their best to ensure that each preview snapshot and release candidate is stable, this is by definition &lt;strong>a pre-release piece of software&lt;/strong>. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="known-issues">Known issues&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>During the Release Candidate stage, we focus exclusively on solving showstopping regressions (i.e. something that worked in a previous release is now broken, without workaround). You can have a look at our current &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/godotengine/projects/61">list of regressions and significant issues&lt;/a> which we aim to address before releasing 4.4. This list is dynamic and will be updated if we discover new blocking issues after more users start testing the RC snapshots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Edit:&lt;/em> A regression was introduced in this snapshot and will be fixed in RC 2:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The change to the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rendering/rendering_device/driver&lt;/code> project setting and its platform overrides to default to a new &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auto&lt;/code> mode in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/103026">GH-103026&lt;/a> caused a regression in the Android and iOS export process, where some necessary configuration is no longer set properly (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/103156">GH-103156&lt;/a>). You can work it around by explicitly setting &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rendering/rendering_device/driver.android&lt;/code> to &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vulkan&lt;/code> and &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rendering/rendering_device/driver.ios&lt;/code> to &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">metal&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>With every release, we are aware that there are going to be various issues which have already been reported but haven’t been fixed yet, due to limited resources. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+">known bugs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bug-reports">Bug reports&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a tester, we encourage you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">open bug reports&lt;/a> if you experience issues with this release. Please check the &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">existing issues on GitHub&lt;/a> first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="support">Support&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Godot is a non-profit, open source game engine developed by hundreds of contributors on their free time, as well as a handful of part and full-time developers hired thanks to &lt;a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">generous donations from the Godot community&lt;/a>. A big thank you to everyone who has contributed &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/AUTHORS.md">their time&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/DONORS.md">their financial support&lt;/a> to the project!&lt;/p>

As such, you can expect this to be our final beta release of the 4.4 period, with release candidates set to come out shortly after. In practice, this means that all further changes will be &lt;em>strictly&lt;/em> regression fixes, so the content available here will be largely reflective of the 4.4 release. As always, users are strongly encouraged to test this snapshot to catch the remaining few release blockers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please, consider &lt;a href="#support">supporting the project financially&lt;/a>, if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors.

While engine maintainers try their best to ensure that each preview snapshot and release candidate is stable, this is by definition &lt;strong>a pre-release piece of software&lt;/strong>. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="known-issues">Known issues&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>During the beta stage, we focus on solving both regressions (i.e. something that worked in a previous release is now broken) and significant new bugs introduced by new features. You can have a look at our current &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/godotengine/projects/61">list of regressions and significant issues&lt;/a> which we aim to address before releasing 4.4. This list is dynamic and will be updated if we discover new showstopping issues after more users start testing the beta snapshots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With every release, we accept that there are going to be various issues which have already been reported but haven’t been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+">known bugs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Changes to scenes are not reflected in APK exports after the initial export in the Android editor. The issue is tracked in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/101007">GH-101007&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="bug-reports">Bug reports&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a tester, we encourage you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">open bug reports&lt;/a> if you experience issues with this release. Please check the &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">existing issues on GitHub&lt;/a> first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="support">Support&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Godot is a non-profit, open source game engine developed by hundreds of contributors on their free time, as well as a handful of part and full-time developers hired thanks to &lt;a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">generous donations from the Godot community&lt;/a>. A big thank you to everyone who has contributed &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/AUTHORS.md">their time&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/DONORS.md">their financial support&lt;/a> to the project!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’d like to support the project financially and help us secure our future hires, you can do so using the &lt;a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">Godot Development Fund&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

You’re not imagining things, it’s only been a week since our last release. The team is fully in the swing of getting release-blockers merged, so we’re able to expedite output. What’s more, our community has been on the ball with submitting regression reports; thanks to everyone who’s involved themselves!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While progress has been at a rate we’re all excited about, it’s not over yet! We’ll likely do one more beta release the following week, but after that we hope to be gearing up for release candidates. If you haven’t already, we encourage users who haven’t engaged with the beta releases to do so and help us catch the last few stragglers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please, consider &lt;a href="#support">supporting the project financially&lt;/a>, if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors. Your donations go towards sponsoring their work and ensuring they can dedicate their undivided attention to the needs of the project.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For an overview of what’s new overall in Godot 4.4, have a look at the highlights for &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-beta-1/">4.4 beta 1&lt;/a>, which cover a lot of the changes. This blog post only covers the changes between beta 2 and beta 3. This section covers the most relevant changes made since the &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-beta-2/">beta 2 snapshot&lt;/a>, which are largely regression fixes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="uid-upgrade-tool">UID upgrade tool&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The introduction of &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.uid&lt;/code> files remains one of the biggest changes to the 4.4 release cycle, so much so that we gave it a &lt;a href="/article/uid-changes-coming-to-godot-4-4/">dedicated article&lt;/a>. However, it hasn’t been the most straightforward system, particularly for those that are attempting to upgrade their projects from 4.3. In order to address this, &lt;a href="https://github.com/Meorge">Malcolm Anderson&lt;/a> has put together a UID upgrade tool to automate this process (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/102071">GH-103071&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="porting-fixes-to-embeddedfloating-window-mode">Porting fixes to Embedded/Floating Window mode&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Embedded/Floating game window option added in 4.4 is proving to be quite popular, but also exposes all kinds of quirks on various systems with how they deal with windows. &lt;a href="https://github.com/Hilderin">Hilderin&lt;/a> did impressive work to track and fix these issues, with pull requests such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/102104">GH-102104&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/102238">GH-102238&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/102251">GH-102251&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/102311">GH-102311&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/102312">GH-102312&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/102470">GH-102470&lt;/a>, and more! The experience should be much better already in beta 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lightmap-baking-improvements">Lightmap baking improvements&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/clayjohn">Clay John&lt;/a> changed the logic for baking direct lighting in LightmapGI to spread it over multiple frames, avoiding a spike of computation that can lead the OS to trigger &lt;abbr title="Timeout Detection and Recovery">TDR&lt;/abbr>, resulting in a crash of the GPU context (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/102257">GH-102257&lt;/a>). With some further fixes like &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/102424">GH-102424&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/102497">GH-102497&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/102477">GH-102477&lt;/a>, lightmap baking got a nice upgrade in this snapshot.&lt;/p>

While engine maintainers try their best to ensure that each preview snapshot and release candidate is stable, this is by definition &lt;strong>a pre-release piece of software&lt;/strong>. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="known-issues">Known issues&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>During the beta stage, we focus on solving both regressions (i.e. something that worked in a previous release is now broken) and significant new bugs introduced by new features. You can have a look at our current &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/godotengine/projects/61">list of regressions and significant issues&lt;/a> which we aim to address before releasing 4.4. This list is dynamic and will be updated if we discover new showstopping issues after more users start testing the beta snapshots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With every release, we accept that there are going to be various issues which have already been reported but haven’t been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+">known bugs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Baking a Lightmap3D is more prone to crash after we added support for transparency. The issue is tracked in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/101391">GH-101391&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Changes to scenes are not reflected in APK exports after the initial export in the Android editor. The issue is tracked in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/101007">GH-101007&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="bug-reports">Bug reports&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a tester, we encourage you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">open bug reports&lt;/a> if you experience issues with this release. Please check the &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">existing issues on GitHub&lt;/a> first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="support">Support&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Godot is a non-profit, open source game engine developed by hundreds of contributors on their free time, as well as a handful of part and full-time developers hired thanks to &lt;a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">generous donations from the Godot community&lt;/a>.

Despite how much the previous snapshot added, it bears repeating that we have entered the 4.4 feature freeze, so our energy has been focused on addressing any new &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aregression+milestone%3A4.4">regressions&lt;/a> or the aforementioned bugs. We’re still aiming for a release sometime next month, but that all depends on how effectively new bugs get reported during this period. Users are strongly encouraged to test these beta releases so this process can be as smooth and expedient as possible!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please, consider &lt;a href="#support">supporting the project financially&lt;/a>, if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors. Your donations go towards sponsoring their work and ensuring they can dedicate their undivided attention to the needs of the project.&lt;/p>

While engine maintainers try their best to ensure that each preview snapshot and release candidate is stable, this is by definition &lt;strong>a pre-release piece of software&lt;/strong>. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="known-issues">Known issues&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>During the beta stage, we focus on solving both regressions (i.e. something that worked in a previous release is now broken) and significant new bugs introduced by new features. You can have a look at our current &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/godotengine/projects/61">list of regressions and significant issues&lt;/a> which we aim to address before releasing 4.4. This list is dynamic and will be updated if we discover new showstopping issues after more users start testing the beta snapshots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With every release, we accept that there are going to be various issues which have already been reported but haven’t been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+">known bugs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Baking a Lightmap3D is more prone to crash after we added support for transparency. The issue is tracked in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/101391">GH-101391&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Changes to scenes are not reflected in APK exports after the initial export in the Android editor. The issue is tracked in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/101007">GH-101007&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="bug-reports">Bug reports&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a tester, we encourage you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">open bug reports&lt;/a> if you experience issues with this release. Please check the &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">existing issues on GitHub&lt;/a> first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="support">Support&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Godot is a non-profit, open source game engine developed by hundreds of contributors on their free time, as well as a handful of part and full-time developers hired thanks to &lt;a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">generous donations from the Godot community&lt;/a>. A big thank you to everyone who has contributed &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/AUTHORS.md">their time&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/DONORS.md">their financial support&lt;/a> to the project!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>And with that, the 2024 season comes to an end. What a year it has been, with the number of Godot submissions in game jams rising to new heights, &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-foundation-update-dec-2024/">more people working for the Godot Foundation than ever before&lt;/a>, and most industry award shows featuring one if not more games made with Godot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A busy year inside the project as well. Too much to compile into a single article, unless you want to read pages of meeting notes and technical documentation. So instead, we chose to celebrate the past by looking back at one cherry-pick per month, something you might have missed during the scuffle but is worth learning about even now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This could be an event the team attended, a major project milestone being reached, or a fun moment online the Godot community gathered around. Likewise, we looked at the release dates of notable &lt;a href="https://steamdb.info/tech/Engine/Godot/">Godot games on Steam&lt;/a> and decided to introduce you to some favorites alongside our own organizational news. The separate tech highlight section might even introduce you to a feature or two you missed out on so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But before we get started, let us sneak in an announcement: this blog post is part of our newsletter project, premiering this January. &lt;a href="https://godot.news/subscription/form">Subscribe to “The Nodeletter”&lt;/a> to get a regular digest of Godot Engine news directly in your email inbox!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="tech-highlights">Tech Highlights&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>To be frank: there is no good way to summarize the work of hundreds of contributors across the span of an entire year without leaving out something important. The closest we can feasibly get are the &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/releases/4.3/">Godot 4.3 release page&lt;/a>, and the newly published &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-beta-1/">Godot 4.4 beta 1 release notes&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the purpose of this retrospective, we approached the engine maintainers directly, asking them to point us at one particularly compelling change they witnessed in their area of expertise. How many of these have you not heard about yet?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img alt="The commit that open-sourced Godot" src="/storage/blog/2024-cherry-picks/commit.webp" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nostalgia became the theme of January, as we compiled a small &lt;a href="https://x.com/godotengine/status/1754601111229497650">game showcase&lt;/a> leading up to Godot’s 10-year-anniversary (counting from the moment the engine was first open sourced). For every year from 2014 to 2024 we shared two gems found on Steam and itch.io with the community, celebrating an ever growing list of Godot releases since the beginnings of the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have a look at that &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac">monumental commit&lt;/a> all those years ago!&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="year-2024-game-box-description">
&lt;p>
Desktop pets have risen to new popularity in 2024. &lt;em>KinitoPET&lt;/em> combines this trend with the evergreen horror genre to bring you a unique experience about virtual assistants.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="february">February&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As part of our social media expansion, we also created an &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/godotengine_official">official Godot Engine account&lt;/a> on the streaming platform Twitch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using it to check on Godot game development streamers resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed9xuwtmoUw">this funny compilation&lt;/a> — both the content creators and their viewers expressed happiness that the communities they had built were being recognized by us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Logically, the next step was to hand over the reins of the channel to some of these talented developers directly. You can find the &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeG_dAglpVo5vWX06WyYThUOydLVmb1Iu&amp;amp;si=WBi8qIJEaSHh42NN">takeover recordings&lt;/a> on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GodotEngineOfficial">our YouTube&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="year-2024-game-box-description">
&lt;p>
Another twist on “gaming directly on a desktop” came in the form of the action roguelike &lt;em>Windowkill&lt;/em>. The twin-stick shooter requires you to keep track of and fight the ever-closing game windows while evading enemies.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="march">March&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In March, the Godot Foundation team assembled in San Francisco to meet community members at our biggest event booth yet, in the expo hall of the annual Game Developer Conference (GDC). We shared the space with our sponsor &lt;a href="https://www.w4games.com/">W4 Games&lt;/a> and an amazing lineup of &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/article/gdc-2024-godot-games/">Godot-powered games&lt;/a> that we had the pleasure of inviting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Group picture at the GDC booth" src="/storage/blog/2024-cherry-picks/gdc.webp" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had a great time, both on the event grounds and at our own gatherings, and made sure to recount our full experience in a &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/article/gdc-2024-retrospective/">retrospective blog post&lt;/a> — see you this year?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>
&lt;em>Backpack Battles&lt;/em> decided to make inventory management the main game mechanic. The PvP auto-battler with a medieval fantasy theme has quickly gained popularity with content creators!

&lt;h2 id="april">April&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Towards the end of 2023 we &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/article/collaboration-with-google-forge-2023/">announced a collaboration with Google and The Forge&lt;/a> to improve the performance of our Vulkan mobile backend. The work concluded in April, with the &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90284">matching PR&lt;/a> being split into the 4.3 and 4.4 releases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Usage of Unified Memory Architecture (UMA) buffers when available&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add Android &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/games/optimize/adpf/thermal">Thermal API&lt;/a> support&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Replace large push constants with dynamic uniform buffers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Optimize descriptor sets and descriptor set batching&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Optimize swapchain operations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Integrate &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/games/sdk/frame-pacing">Swappy frame pacing&lt;/a> from the Google AGDK&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h2 id="may">May&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Did you know that we still update Godot 3? Not everyone upgraded their projects when the big codebase refresh happened last year, so by offering two versions alongside each other we aim to accommodate these existing games as well as the lower-end systems used by some developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The feature freeze for 3.6 happened in May, leading up to the most recent &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-3-6-finally-released/">release in September&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Look at these shiny highlights:&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="year-2024-game-box-description">
&lt;p>
This game about cooking eggs in a cold climate found great reception on the internet. There is just something about the frustratingly fun mechanics of &lt;em>Arctic Eggs&lt;/em> that captured quite an audience — who are we to judge your taste?
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>

&lt;h2 id="june">June&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our annual community poll rolled around in June. We want to know who our users are, so we can learn about common needs and offer the best support possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eicOppRQG2RFZ8CjIGFf5Kha5yklO854fV8-YFtlWxk/viewanalytics">This year’s poll&lt;/a> had more responses than ever before, once again proving the incredible growth the Godot community is experiencing.&lt;/p>

Nominated for a plethora of awards, the visual novel &lt;em>Until Then&lt;/em> tells the emotional story of the highschooler Mark in polished pixel art. Build relationships, play minigames, use social media, and most importantly: solve the mystery at hand.

&lt;h2 id="july">July&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.makeship.com/products/godot-robot-plush">Godot robot plushies&lt;/a> took the internet by storm. In a collaboration with Makeship, we finally proved our infamous logo’s worth. Toothy grin and googly eyes translated adorably into the 3D medium. By the end of the campaign, almost 4,000 cuddly coding companions were headed towards new homes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aside from the profits being funneled into the &lt;a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">Godot Development Fund&lt;/a> and thereby opening an additional path to supporting the project financially, the plush also became a beloved community icon. Fanart was made, models of the robot were shared, and the character was granted countless cameos in games made with the engine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="3D model of the Godot robot plush" src="/storage/blog/2024-cherry-picks/plush.webp" />

&lt;p>As an open-source community, the Godot project thrives in matters of community maintained extensions. To ensure that valuable knowledge does not get lost once a creator decides to step down, we opened a new GitHub organization called &lt;a href="https://github.com/godot-sdk-integrations">Godot SDK Integrations&lt;/a> to host such projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read more in our detailed &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-sdk-integrations/">blogpost on the topic&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On top of that, we introduced a game showcase and activities to the event schedule. Increasing our scope like so, we hoped to invite a wider variety of visitors to enjoy mingling with other community members and facilitate networking.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To celebrate the occasion (and snatch the coveted number) our Release Manager wrote a &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/article/beyond-100000-you-re-breathtaking/">heartwarming blogpost&lt;/a> that cannot be done justice by summarizing — so go read it for yourself!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Concluding our walk through memory lane, the only thing left to say is &lt;strong>thank you&lt;/strong>. To those of you who contribute to the engine by code, donations, or growing the community through content creation. To our users, who help promote the project with their own success and battletest new features in real time. We also want to once again thank our &lt;a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/#credits">corporate sponsors&lt;/a> for believing in what we do. Lastly, I want to give a shoutout to my wonderful colleagues, for if they weren’t so incredibly dedicated to organizing and maintaining a collaboration this big, none of this would be possible either.&lt;/p>

This officially marks the start of feature freeze for 4.4. This means contributors are encouraged to focus their efforts on fixing &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aregression+milestone%3A4.4">regressions&lt;/a> and other outstanding bugs. We won’t risk merging any new features or risky bug fixes until after we release 4.4 and begin preparing for 4.5.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will aim to release 4.4 in around a month, but as usual, this timeline will depend on how quickly we are able to fix the outstanding bugs and what new bugs are identified in the beta process. We ask that users test these beta releases and report bugs as soon as you spot them to help us ensure a quick beta period and a timely release of 4.4.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please, consider &lt;a href="#support">supporting the project financially&lt;/a>, if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors. Your donations go towards sponsoring their work and ensuring they can dedicate their undivided attention to the needs of the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="#downloads">Jump to the &lt;strong>Downloads&lt;/strong> section&lt;/a>, and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also &lt;a href="https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.4.beta1/">try the &lt;strong>Web editor&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> or the &lt;strong>Android editor&lt;/strong> for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers">our testing group&lt;/a> to get access to pre-release builds.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>The cover illustration is from&lt;/em> &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3146520/WEBFISHING/">&lt;strong>WEBFISHING&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, &lt;em>a multiplayer online casual fishing game where you relax, hang out, make friends, and catch fish! You can buy the game &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3146520/WEBFISHING/">on Steam&lt;/a>, and follow the development on &lt;a href="https://x.com/westthewerst">Twitter&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many features originally intended for 4.3 ended up making it into 4.4 meaning that Godot 4.4 is jam-packed with new features
despite having a much shorter development period than 4.3.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="new-in-beta-1">New in Beta 1!&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Normally our Beta 1 release notes summarize all the most exciting changes from the previous dev releases. But the team managed to merge an unusually large number of exciting PRs right before the beta this time around, so we would like to first introduce some of the exciting changes that are new in this beta.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A short word of warning, new means “untested”, so consider the following the most untested part of the beta release and make sure to let us know if you run into any issues!&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="game-window-embedding">Game window embedding&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Game window embedding makes it possible to run the game while being able to interact with the full editor window, without needing to move the game window to the side of the editor window. This is particularly useful on single-monitor setups and laptops where screen real estate is at a premium. However, this was challenging to implement as Godot runs the game as a separate process from the editor for two reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The game process uses its own address space and therefore doesn’t have to share CPU/GPU resources with the editor (or at least, not as much as if it was the same process).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most importantly, if the game crashes for any reason, the editor does not crash at the same time (which could cause data loss).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The approach we decided upon relies on window management tricks instead, so that the game window is still a separate process, but it &lt;em>looks&lt;/em> like it’s embedded within the editor. Contributor Hilderin took upon this task and implemented seamless window embedding on Windows and Linux. Support in Android is coming in Beta 2 while support in macOS will require a different approach for technical reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Game window embedding was implemented to support our recent interactive in-game editing feature. Now you can easily run your game, override the game camera, and select objects in game, all from the editor!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/storage/blog/godot-4-4-beta-1/embedded-editor.webp" alt="Embedding game window in main editor" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more information and a handy video, check out the PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99010">GH-99010&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="use-property-editors-instead-of-labels-to-display-keys">Use property editors instead of labels to display keys&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>With the addition of typed dictionaries, one glaring issue quickly revealed itself in the inspector: keys were always displayed as strings! While this was the case even before typed dictionaries, the issue only became more pronounced as it undermined the benefits of static-typing. bruvzg came to the rescue with &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100512">GH-100512&lt;/a>, which allows the inspector to treat ALL dictionary keys as a read-only field for their respective types.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="apple-game-controller-improvements">Apple Game Controller improvements&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>We’ve made some improvements to how Game Controllers work on iOS and macOS. We’ve unified the code to make sure it works the same on both platforms, and we’ve fixed some bugs. These changes improve reliability of controller discovery and manipulating the rumble motors, which should make the gaming experience even better. You can learn more about these changes in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/94580">GH-94580&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="add-2d-shader-instance-uniforms">Add 2D shader instance uniforms&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Previously, Godot only supported shader instance uniforms in Spatial shaders. Thanks to KoBeWi, EIREXE, huwpascoe, and Patrick Exner this release will add support for shader instance uniforms for CanvasItem shaders (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99230">GH-99230&lt;/a>). Shader instance uniforms allow you to assign a different value to the uniform for each CanvasItem that uses it. Importantly, this works without breaking batching, so it can be used as a performant way to add unique effects to CanvasItems without having to juggle materials.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="add-visualization-of-3d-particle-emission-shapes">Add visualization of 3D particle emission shapes&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Up until now, users of the particle system had to guess from the emission shape properties where particles would appear. This improvement (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100113">GH-100113&lt;/a>) by Patrick Exner adds a visualization of the emission shapes for 3D CPU and GPU particle systems.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;h4 id="add-support-for-metalfx-upscaling-on-macos-and-ios">Add support for MetalFX upscaling on macOS and iOS&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>We’ve added support for MetalFX upscaling as an option for Apple platforms using the Metal driver. MetalFX provides a high-performance alternative to FSR1 or FSR2, leveraging Apple’s optimized GPU pipeline to deliver smooth upscaling and enhanced visual fidelity with minimal overhead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This integration ensures developers targeting macOS or iOS can achieve excellent rendering quality and performance on supported Apple hardware. For more details, check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99603">GH-99603&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="add-support-for-agx-tone-mapping">Add support for AgX tone mapping&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>AgX is the cool, new kid on the block when it comes to tone mapping algorithms. Last year Blender made waves by replacing their previous “filmic” tone mapper with AgX. We have implemented a version of AgX that closely matches Blender’s while being not quite as high quality, but much more suitable for real time. AgX is a stylized tone mapper intended to give a filmic quality to images that handles very bright scenes much better than our other tone mappers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/storage/blog/godot-4-4-beta-1/tonemap.webp" alt="ACES tone mapping left, AgX right" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="add-transparency-support-for-lightmapgi">Add transparency support for LightmapGI&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Currently when baking lightmaps users have to choose between transparent objects casting shadows as if they were fully opaque, or not casting shadows at all. This has been a major limitation in both the quality of lightmap baking and the ergonomics of the lightmap baking workflow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99538">GH-99538&lt;/a>, Hendrik Brucker added support for baking with transparent objects, including having tinted shadows (something that dynamic shadows don’t support yet). Since this is brand new in Beta 1, please test it carefully and report any issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/storage/blog/godot-4-4-beta-1/lightmap-color.webp" alt="Lightmap shaders with color" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We try to minimize breaking changes, but sometimes they are necessary in order to fix high priority issues. Where we do break compatibility, we do our best to make sure that the changes are minimal and require few changes in user projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find a list of such issues by filtering the merged PRs in the 4.4 milestone with the &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=milestone%3A4.4%20is%3Amerged%20label%3A%22breaks%20compat%22">&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">breaks compat&lt;/code> label&lt;/a>. Here are some which are worth being aware of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/article/uid-changes-coming-to-godot-4-4/">Universal UID support.&lt;/a> This will create several &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.uid&lt;/code> files for resources that lacked this metadata. &lt;strong>These should be added to version control&lt;/strong>, much like &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.import&lt;/code> files. (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97352">GH-97352&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Floats converted to strings now display as a decimal by default, even for whole numbers. This makes printed types more explicit, which can be used to catch bugs that were previously invisible. That is: &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print(1.0)&lt;/code> will now print &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.0&lt;/code> instead of &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1&lt;/code>. (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/47502">GH-47502&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Changed &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KEY_MODIFIER_MASK&lt;/code> to correct value. Unlikely to directly affect any projects, as the previous value was simply wrong. (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/98441">GH-98441&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Control’s &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">offset_*&lt;/code> get/set type changed from &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int&lt;/code> to &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float&lt;/code>. This matches the behavior described in the documentation. (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/98443">GH-98443&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OpenXR&lt;/code> action maps opened in Godot 4.4 aren’t compatible with earlier versions. (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/98163">GH-98163&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CSGMesh3D&lt;/code> now explicitly requires the mesh to be manifold. A manifold mesh must be closed, have each edge connected to only two faces, and have volume. Commonly, this means that it needs to be a “watertight” mesh without any holes and where you can never see the backside of the triangles. (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100014">GH-100014&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>StringName Dictionary keys are saved as-is, without being converted to String beforehand. For the majority of cases this shouldn’t cause breakage, as String &amp;amp; StringName are largely interchangeable. This should only be relevant when performing type-checking (&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is&lt;/code>, &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is_instance_of()&lt;/code>, &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typeof()&lt;/code>) and/or strict comparison (&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is_same()&lt;/code>). (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70096">GH-70096&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove “Raycast Normals” and associated “Normal Split Angle” settings from LOD import. We removed this because the quality is almost always better now without it and import time is much faster without it. (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/93727">GH-93727&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make PopupMenu/Panel shadows properly visible again. This makes PopupMenu/Panel’s transparent by default now. When using non-embedded popups, you will still need to enable &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display/window/per_pixel_transparency/allowed&lt;/code> to see the shadows. (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/91333">GH-91333&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The names of imported blend shapes and animation libraries from glTF files have changed as unsupported characters are automatically removed. All “&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:&lt;/code>” for blendshapes are now removed, and any of “&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/&lt;/code>”, “&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:&lt;/code>”, “&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,&lt;/code>”, and “&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[&lt;/code>” are removed for animation libraries. (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/94783">GH-94783&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Change NavigationMesh to also parse collision shapes by default. This is part of an effort to encourage users to use collision shapes for NavigationMesh instead of visual meshes as collision shapes are much simpler and thus more efficient for Navigation. (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/95013">GH-95013&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>XR: Disable hand tracking by default. This has a non-trivial performance cost and is not needed for many games. Users need to enable the setting if they want to use hand tracking now. (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/95153">GH-95153&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automatically resolve initial and final action for draw lists. &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RenderingDevice.draw_list_begin()&lt;/code> has been vastly simplified and so it will be much easier to use. The old method signature will continue to work, but we recommend using the new method since it is much simpler. (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/98670">GH-98670&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Editor camera override has moved from the editor viewport to the “Game” tab. (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97257">GH-97257&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>UIDs in particular are a pretty massive shake-up to existing project structures, and have understandably been among the more contentious changes of the 4.4 development cycle. Read this blog post to better understand the rationale behind that change, as well as the benefits it brings to the table: &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/article/uid-changes-coming-to-godot-4-4/">UID changes coming to Godot 4.4&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="animation">Animation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One of our newest additions to the animator’s toolkit is markers (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/91765">GH-91765&lt;/a>) by ChocolaMint. Markers allow you to create sub regions of an animation that can be jumped to, or looped without playing the entire animation. This functionality is even supported inside AnimationTree, where you can easily create an AnimationNode’s custom timeline based on the markers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’ve also added &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LookAtModifier3D&lt;/code> (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/98446">GH-98446&lt;/a>) to handle 3D model procedural animation, partially replacing the deprecated &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SkeletonIK3D&lt;/code>. Thanks to the efforts of animation expert Silc Renew (Tokage), users no longer need to rely on specific bone structures and arbitrary layouts; this new tool allows for angle limitations, forward axis settings, etc., and is specialized for making a 3D character model look in the target direction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sneaking in right before the feature freeze, the Animation team added &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SpringBoneSimulator3D&lt;/code>(&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/101409">GH-101409&lt;/a>) as well. The spring bone is an open source cross-platform module that is distributed by the &lt;a href="https://vrm-consortium.org/en/">VRM consortium&lt;/a> under the MIT license. It has been available in Godot as an &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2031">add-on&lt;/a> for a while now, but there were some difficulties in stability and complex setup due to the complicated data structure. Tokage refined it based on &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SkeletonModifier3D&lt;/code> with some improvements by leaning on existing core functionality, so it is now much improved and easier to use!&lt;/p>
&lt;video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
&lt;source src="/storage/blog/godot-4-4-beta-1/springbone.webm?1" type="video/webm" />
&lt;/video>
&lt;h3 id="audio">Audio&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>First-time contributor what-is-a-git implemented the long-requested support for runtime loading of WAV files (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/93831">GH-93831&lt;/a>). This adds parity with Ogg Vorbis audio tracks, and will be a welcome addition for users who want to load user-generated content at runtime (including non-game audio applications).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="c">C#&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Paul Joannon and Raul Santos have put the final pieces in place for moving both the GodotSharp library and user projects to .NET 8 (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92131">GH-92131&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100195">GH-100195&lt;/a>). All new projects will use .NET 8 by default and existing projects will automatically update to .NET 8 once opened with this release or any newer 4.4 build. For more details, check out the recent article on &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godotsharp-packages-net8/">Godot C# packages moving to .NET 8&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For C# developers targeting Android platforms, exported projects will now use the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">android&lt;/code> runtime identifier (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/88803">GH-88803&lt;/a>). This means C# Android exports now support all available architectures (arm32, arm64, x32, and x64) whereas previously it only supported 64-bit architectures. The necessary Java library to bind the .NET cryptography implementation to the Android OS functions is now also included in exported projects, which fixes issues such as crashing when using SSL with the BCL-provided &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HttpClient&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="core">Core&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As mentioned in our &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-7/">last development update&lt;/a>, the improvements to the core of our codebase have been absolutely staggering! Lukas Tenbrink has spearheaded optimizations to strings and the speed/efficiency at which they’re parsed. Adam Scott opened the door for tool makers to take advantage of temporary files and directories (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/98397">GH-98397&lt;/a>). Ocean has broadened the scope in which &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Curve&lt;/code> can be applied, allowing for domains outside of &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[0, 1]&lt;/code> (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/67857">GH-67857&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But perhaps the biggest highlight of them all is Typed Dictionaries. After the introduction of Typed Arrays in 4.0 by George Marques (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/46830">GH-46830&lt;/a>), Typed Dictionaries rapidly became one of the engine’s most requested features. Thanks to the efforts of Thaddeus Crews (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/78656">GH-78656&lt;/a>), this is finally a reality! This feature being implemented at the core of the engine means that all scripting languages (GDScript, C#, C++) can take advantage by interfacing with Godot’s Dictionary type. You can now export typed dictionaries from scripts and benefit from a much improved Inspector UX to assign the right keys and values.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="editor">Editor&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Thanks to the contribution from YeldhamDev of Lone Wolf Technology and W4 Games we now have a new “Game” tab along with the existing “2D”, 3D”, “Script”, and “AssetLib” tabs that allows users to have fine-tuned control over the running game from the editor. This includes overriding the in-game camera and selecting objects in game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check out the PR (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97257">GH-97257&lt;/a>) and the video below to see exactly what this change enables.&lt;/p>
&lt;video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
&lt;source src="/storage/blog/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-4/game-editor-debug.mp4?1" type="video/mp4" />
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>See also &lt;em>game window embedding&lt;/em> further above, which works in tandem with this feature. Note that these features can be used separately: you can still make use of interactive in-game editing even if the game is split to a separate window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Manipulating Camera3Ds in the editor is also improved! With Haoyu Qiu’s new feature in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90778">GH-90778&lt;/a>, every selected 3D camera shows a preview inside the inspector. No switching cameras needed to preview anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hilderin valiantly fought their way through a labyrinth of dependencies and multi-threading pitfalls, and brought us back the long awaited grail: error-less first import of projects. This took a lot of effort between multiple PRs (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92303">GH-92303&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/93972">GH-93972&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92667">GH-92667&lt;/a>), but resolves a major annoyance faced by any user who downloaded an existing project from online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, with this newfound knowledge, Hilderin also further improved the first project import experience to make the FileSystem dock more responsive while resources are being scanned (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/93064">GH-93064&lt;/a>) and improve the overall editor startup speed for large projects (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/95678">GH-95678&lt;/a>). Large projects can expect up to a 3× speed improvement when loading the project and a similar speedup when doing any operations that scan the filesystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>HP van Braam was able to make a similar performance improvement when moving or renaming nodes in the SceneTree (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99700">GH-99700&lt;/a>). Godot should now feel much faster when editing large scenes with hundreds or thousands of nodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The debugger panel now features an expression evaluator which adds a new tab to the debugger panel that allows you to evaluate expressions using the local state of your scripts while stopped at a breakpoint. Many users are familiar with this workflow from other REPL debuggers. This feature has been a work in progress for awhile and was recently finished and merged in (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97647">GH-97647&lt;/a>). Thank you to Oğuzhan, Erik, and Tomek for bringing it across the finish line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To further improve your debugging experience Hendrik introduced a checkbox that allows you to start the profiler automatically when you run your game from the editor and capture valuable profiling data immediately (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/96759">GH-96759&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The editor has become more ergonomic for everyone! Ryevdokimov added object snapping for moving 3D objects in the editor (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/96740">GH-96740&lt;/a>) which allows you to snap existing objects to other objects when you move them. This can be toggled on by selecting an object and pressing Shift+G.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>To reduce clutter in your inspector and highlight the properties you care the most about, YeldhamDev brings us the long-awaited ability to pin one’s favorite properties in the inspector! Check out the implementation in PR &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97352">GH-97352&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Danil Alexeev, the GDScript code editor will now display a tooltip containing information about functions, variables, classes, etc. when you hover over them, including the documentation you have written using our documentation system (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/91060">GH-91060&lt;/a>). This makes using the integrated documentation system even more powerful as you no longer have to bounce between the code editor and the related docs to quickly get information.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="gdscript">GDScript&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This release GDScript saw quite a few quality of life features to improve your development experience. For example, you can now create buttons in the inspector seamlessly using the new &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@export_tool_button&lt;/code> annotation in &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@tool&lt;/code> scripts. This was added by Macksaur in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/96290">GH-96290&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Danil Alexeev brings us &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@warning_ignore_start&lt;/code> and &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@warning_ignore_restore&lt;/code> (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76020">GH-76020&lt;/a>) to suppress warnings in a safely scoped manner across entire sections of code. Similarly, &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@warning_ignore&lt;/code> no longer works when applied to a function. This is because it previously had undocumented functionality which applied the warning to the &lt;em>entire function&lt;/em> unexpectedly. Now users have much more control and the annotations should function more like what you would expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="import">Import&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>4.4 is coming with huge improvements to texture importing quality and speed thanks to new maintainer Bluecube3310. The import times of textures using the “VRAM Compressed” import setting have been greatly improved by integrating the GPU-based Betsy texture compressor. The biggest difference is observable when importing HDR images (such as HDRIs or lightmaps), which used to take up to several minutes before. Thanks to Betsy, as well as other optimizations to the import process (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92291">GH-92291&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/95291">GH-95291&lt;/a>), that time has gone down significantly. Additionally, textures not using the “High Quality” import setting should look better by default, since previously we had to trade the quality for faster import times. Further, there have been countless improvements to the texture import process to improve compatibility across devices and the number of texture formats supported. Overall, texture importing should feel faster and more stable than ever before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new retargeting method, RetargetModifier3D, a new feature from Tokage allows users to use animation retargeting without discarding the original bone rests that were set in the external DCC (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97824">GH-97824&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Godot now supports the &lt;a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_animation_pointer">&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KHR_animation_pointer&lt;/code>&lt;/a> glTF extension thanks to the efforts of Aaron Franke (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/94165">GH-94165&lt;/a>). This allows imported animations to target custom properties in addition to position, rotation, scale, and mesh blend shape weights (which were all it previously supported). For example, you can now animate the color of a light, the FOV of a camera, the albedo color of a material, the UV offset of a material, and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="input">Input&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Input saw a lot of incremental improvements and polish this dev cycle. Notably, rptfrg made their first contribution by lowering the default deadzone for new actions from 0.5 down to 0.2 (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97281">GH-97281&lt;/a>). This should make input feel much more responsive by default. And, after several years of diligent effort, Markus Sauermann has expanded the Drag-and-Drop system to support dragging and dropping across different &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Viewports&lt;/code> and even &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Windows&lt;/code>. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/67531">GH-67531&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="navigation">Navigation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Navigation contains some of the oldest code in the engine. While it continues to serve its purpose, much of it is getting dated and needs to be cleaned up. Accordingly, the Navigation team, especially smix8, have bravely stepped up and begun the difficult process of improving legacy code. Fortunately, their work has already begun to bear fruit in the form of a cleaner codebase and faster Navigation features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notably, the navigation map synchronization now happens asynchronously and in a background thread so it has a much smaller impact on framerate. Instead of making the entire game slow down on lower end systems, updates will just happen less frequently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There have also been many quality of life improvements such as debug indicators to show the direction of NavigationLinks (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/101010">GH-101010&lt;/a>) and support for transforming NavigationObstacle nodes using the node’s transform (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/96730">GH-96730&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="physics">Physics&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Ever since its inception in late 2022, godot-jolt has slowly become the de-facto 3D physics engine for many of our developers. So it is no surprise that the Godot Jolt maintainers, Mikael Hermansson and Jorrit Rouwe, have taken things a step further and integrated Jolt as part of the engine directly. There was already a symbiosis between their team and Godot, with many features being added to Godot and Jolt to accommodate both, but the integration of an official module was no small feat; their pull request (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99895">GH-99895&lt;/a>) ended up adding over 500 files and 115 thousand lines of code!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: At time of writing, this does not replace Godot Physics as the default 3D physics engine. The Jolt Physics integration in Godot is considered experimental, and may change in future releases. It also lacks some features of Godot Physics, so it isn’t a full drop-in replacement. If your interests/use-case are supported, the tool can be enabled by changing the &lt;strong>Physics &amp;gt; 3D &amp;gt; Physics Engine&lt;/strong> project setting to &lt;strong>Jolt Physics&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our hope is that many users opt to use Jolt as their 3D physics backend and give us valuable feedback so we can improve our integration with Jolt and eventually make it the default physics engine for all new projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="platforms">Platforms&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="linux">Linux&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>pkowal1982’s long-running pull request, &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/53666">GH-53666&lt;/a>, was finally merged adding camera support for the Linux platform, allowing developers to access connected cameras from within their game.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="android">Android&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Thanks to the tireless efforts of Fredia Huya-Kouadio and Anish Mishra (our newest Android maintainer), the development experience on Android devices for Android devices has become significantly better. In &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/93526">GH-93526&lt;/a> Fredia added support for exporting games from the Android editor. Previously developers had to leave their Android device when they exported their game. Fredia also added support for launching the Play window in PiP mode (in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/95700">GH-95700&lt;/a>) allowing developers to more easily take advantage of the tight integration between the editor and running game while developing on Android devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To further improve the development experience on Android, Anish added support for the native file picker (in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/98350">GH-98350&lt;/a>) so now Android game and app developers can benefit from using the file picker that Android provides and Android users are accustomed to. Similarly, Fredia added the new AndroidRuntime plugin which exposes the Android Runtime, making it easier to access Android libraries and SDKs in games/apps. For example, for APIs bundled in the Android OS, no additional setup is required and they can be accessed directly using this new plugin. For more details, see &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97500">GH-97500&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="rendering-and-shaders">Rendering and shaders&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many monumental rendering changes were finished towards the end of the 4.3 dev cycle slightly too late to be included in 4.3. As a result, 4.4 contains a massive amount of exciting features, too many to include here, but here are a few.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Apple users, Stuart Carnie has been hard at work ensuring that you get the benefit of the best performance by incorporating the Metal rendering backend (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/88199">GH-88199&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-1/">Dev snapshot: Godot 4.4 dev 1&lt;/a>) and the MetalFX upscaler (mentioned above).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DarioSamo spent several months last year perfecting the Ubershader system which was earlier designed by Juan Linietsky and Clay John in the early days of building Godot 4. The Ubershader allows the engine to compile a flexible, but slow version of shaders at load time which can be used as a fallback while the optimized shaders compile in the background. The technique allows users to ship games &lt;strong>without shader stutter&lt;/strong> and without resorting to manually displaying every possible material and object combination behind a loading screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shadow caster masks, a long awaited improvement from EMBYRDEV, allow users to apply a mask on Light3Ds to select what rendering layers will be considered when casting shadows (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85338">GH-85338&lt;/a>). Previously, it was only possible to disable shadows from a GeometryInstance (for all Light3Ds) or a Light3D (for all GeometryInstances). This allows much more fine-grained control that allows users to further optimize dynamic lights and control where shadows appear in their games.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After tackling the Metal rendering backend merged in an earlier snapshot, Stuart took on another impressive rendering contribution: 2D batching! Batching has been implemented in the Compatibility renderer since the release of 4.0. This release brings the same performance benefits to the other backends by implementing batching when using the Forward+ and Mobile backends (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92797">GH-92797&lt;/a>). Now 2D performance is comparable between all backends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Continuing their excellent work on texture import and the Betsy texture compressor, BlueCube has made huge improvements to the lightmapper by adding:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Support for bicubic sampling to smooth out the results of low resolution lightmap bakes (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/89919">GH-89919&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shadow masks, to allow falling back on baked lighting when outside of the range of dynamic lights (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85653">GH-85653&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Compression for lightmap textures to reduce the memory use and rendering overhead of large lightmap textures (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100327">GH-100327&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Hendrik Brucker, a long time contributor, also decided that lightmaps deserved some attention this release and carried the work of Hugo Locurcio and Guerro323 over the finish line by implementing lightmap supersampling (which bakes the lightmap at a higher resolution to reduce aliasing and capture finer details) and adding support for transparent objects to lightmap baking (including semi-transparent shadows).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ricardo Buring continued his amazing work in bringing physics interpolation to Godot 4. This time around he added support for 3D objects (include Multimesh!). Physics interpolation is a technique that allows you to run your physics update at a very low FPS while maintaining smooth movement. This allows you to both save CPU overhead and make your game look much smoother.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>After pointing out the many limitations that exist with ReflectionProbes, Lander-vr decided to take matters into his own hands and personally overhaul the blending logic for ReflectionProbes in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100241">GH-100241&lt;/a> to make smaller probes automatically take priority over larger probes, which avoids the “double reflection” effects that can look strange. Additionally, in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99958">GH-99958&lt;/a>, he added a blend distance property so you can now configure the distance at which the reflection starts fading. The default distance at which reflections start fading is now much lower than before, which ensures the full reflection can be seen when inside the ReflectionProbe’s bounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not content to stop there, Lander-vr also significantly improved the editor UX for ReflectionProbe and VoxelGI by making their gizmos less intrusive (in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99920">GH-99920&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99969">GH-99969&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100370">GH-100370&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/storage/blog/godot-4-4-beta-1/reflection-probes.webp" alt="Sponza with reflective floor" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After many requests and years of patient waiting from many within the community, we have finally re-introduced vertex shading which is both a significant performance optimization and and integral part of recreating PSX-style graphics (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/83360">GH-83360&lt;/a>). This turned out to be a significant endeavor for ywmaa who enlisted the help of veteran rendering contributor Clay John to get the feature over the finish line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently when trying to run Godot with the Forward+ or Mobile backend on a device that doesn’t support Vulkan, D3D12, or Metal, the engine will provide the user with an OS alert notifying them that they don’t have support for the needed graphics API and they need to try again with the Compatibility backend. This alert has proven to be confusing for users and the process of opening the scene ends up being cumbersome. Now with &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97142">GH-97142&lt;/a>, the first contribution from SheepYhangCN, the engine will automatically fall back to using OpenGL (the Compatibility backend) when the other backends are not available. This should provide the smoothest possible experience for users on older devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rendering contributors have been relentless in identifying and implementing performance enhancements this release cycle. Many areas of the renderers, both 2D and 3D have been optimized and we expect that many users will notice an improvement to performance this release cycle, especially for 2D lighting, rendering on mobile devices, and general 2D rendering.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="xr">XR&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Thanks to Godot’s unique feature of its editor being made with the engine itself, we’ve been able to bring the Godot editor to unconventional places, such as the web and Android devices. Building upon the latter, Fredia Huya-Kouadio completed the proof of concept started by Bastiaan Olij years ago, to add support for using the Android editor on XR devices using OpenXR (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/96624">GH-96624&lt;/a>)! The XR editor is currently available on the Meta Quest 3 and Quest Pro through the &lt;a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/godot-game-engine/7713660705416473/">Horizon Store&lt;/a>. Support for the PICO 4 Ultra is also in progress and will be available soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OpenXR support for Metal (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/98872">GH-98872&lt;/a>) has been added, improving the developer experience for MacOS developers using the Meta XR Simulator.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some OpenXR runtimes support applying modifiers to the action map, for example, applying thresholds or haptic triggers, and now you can configure those in Godot as well (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97140">GH-97140&lt;/a>)!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Support for OpenXR composition layers was added in Godot 4.3, allowing developers to show crisp and clear 2D panels that show content from a Godot &lt;strong>SubViewport&lt;/strong>. Now, in Godot 4.4, we’ve added the ability to show content from an Android surface as well, allowing for performant media playback in XR on Android (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/96185">GH-96185&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="changelog">Changelog&lt;/h2>

Read on to know what's required on your part to fully benefit from it.</summary><description>&lt;h2 id="why-use-uids-in-godot">Why use UIDs in Godot?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Until Godot 4.0, the engine exclusively relied on file paths to refer to scenes, scripts and other resources. While this means references in scenes and scripts use human-readable paths, these paths will break if files are moved to a different location in the project (regardless of whether the move was done using the FileSystem dock or outside Godot). This is especially problematic for large projects where filesystem organization often changes regularly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since Godot 3.x, the editor already updates path references if files are moved within the FileSystem dock. This works more or less, but has drawbacks: the process is slow in large projects (as files need to be scanned and modified), file paths in scripts are left unchanged, and a single file move can result in a large amount of modified files in commits. It’s also not fully reliable, and veteran Godot users probably remember various situations where moving a file seemingly corrupted a scene or resource.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, it is common for users to move these files outside Godot (e.g. using the OS file manager, an IDE or the command line). If the editor is not open, it has no way to know the change happened. Even if the editor is open, when working with version control, files may change or be moved and the editor has no way to know where files have gone, resulting in all sorts of errors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the aim of making Godot better suited for large projects and significantly more resilient to external filesystem changes, ensuring this is a fully supported workflow has become a priority. External file manager programs often have more features than Godot’s own FileSystem dock, making them more convenient for many use cases. This means we need an approach that can reliably track files being moved, even if the Godot editor isn’t open.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Partial “Unique IDentifier” (UID) support was therefore introduced in Godot 4.0, which made it possible for users to safely move files outside Godot if they have UID support implemented. The editor will automatically store resource references as UIDs, with the path still being stored alongside for displaying in the editor UI (and as a fallback if the UID reference becomes invalid). However, UID support wasn’t completely finished by the time Godot 4.0 released, which means many file types didn’t benefit from the UID system entirely (if at all).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="limitations-of-uids-before-godot-44">Limitations of UIDs before Godot 4.4&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Each imported resource in Godot has a &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.import&lt;/code> file, which allows for storing a UID. Additionally, Godot’s own scene and resource file formats store a UID in their header. However, scripts and shaders are not imported resources and they are “plain text” formats, without any Godot-specific information stored within. In practice, this meant that UIDs could be used for scenes and most resources, but not scripts and shaders. The UID implementation was therefore not covering every resource type Godot support (&lt;a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_script.html">scripts&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_shader.html">shaders&lt;/a> are resources too).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, the editor support for making use of UIDs and relying primarily on them was lacking, so UIDs didn’t yet fulfill their promise of enabling seamless refactoring of project files.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-changing-with-uids-in-godot-44">What’s changing with UIDs in Godot 4.4&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To resolve the issue of scripts and shaders not being able to benefit from the UID system, dedicated UID files are being introduced in Godot 4.4. These files are automatically generated by Godot when saving a script or shader and are placed besides the source file with the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.uid&lt;/code> extension as a suffix. For example, if you have &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">some_file.gd&lt;/code> and &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">some_file.shader&lt;/code>, Godot will generate the files &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">some_file.gd.uid&lt;/code> and &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">some_file.shader.uid&lt;/code>. This avoids conflicts in case a script and shader file have the same name (but a different extension) within the same folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This now means you can use UID references in your own scripts if you wish. While using file paths is still the primary approach for now, using UIDs means that the paths to other referenced resources can safely change without breaking the script, even if the files are moved outside Godot.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="language-gdscript highlighter-rouge">&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre class="highlight">&lt;code>&lt;span class="k">extends&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">Node&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="c1"># These references point to the same Script resource.&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="c1"># `other_script.gd` contains a `static func greet()` that prints some text.&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="k">var&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">other_script&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nb">preload&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s2">"res://other_script.gd"&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">)&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="c1"># TIP: You can copy any resource's UID from the FileSystem dock's context menu.&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="k">var&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">other_script_uid&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nb">preload&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s2">"uid://fkjlqx8er2sg"&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">)&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="k">func&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nf">_ready&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">():&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="n">other_script&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">greet&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">()&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="n">other_script_uid&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">greet&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">()&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100803">GH-100803&lt;/a>, you can see the underlying &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">res://&lt;/code> path and resource type when hovering the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uid://&lt;/code> path with the mouse in the script editor. (This feature also works when hovering &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">res://&lt;/code> paths, so it is not exclusive to &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uid://&lt;/code> paths.)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-should-i-change-in-my-project-or-workflow">What should I change in my project or workflow?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The most important step is to &lt;strong>make sure &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.uid&lt;/code> files are committed to version control&lt;/strong>. In other words, &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.uid&lt;/code> should &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> be added to &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, when you move a script or shader outside Godot, &lt;strong>you should also move the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.uid&lt;/code> file along with it&lt;/strong>. When you remove a script or shader outside Godot, you should also remove the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.uid&lt;/code> file, although this is less important – not removing the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.uid&lt;/code> file won’t break anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moving files externally will produce warnings when opening scenes referencing said files. You need to re-save all depending scenes to remove warnings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After upgrading the project to 4.4, you should re-save all scenes and resources to add any missing UID references. The editor will add them automatically as you save scenes/resources for the first time with 4.4, but it’s better to do it all at once to avoid random diffs appearing in version control later on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="why-not-use-another-approach-to-track-file-references-like-checksums">Why not use another approach to track file references like checksums?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Godot already keeps track of checksums in &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.import&lt;/code> files. This is used to detect whether the file has actually changed, and can therefore reimport the file if it has changed while Godot wasn’t open.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, checksums are the wrong tool for the job to keep track of &lt;strong>unique&lt;/strong> file references. If you have two files with the exact same content, they would have the same checksum, but these files are still separately referenced by other scenes or resources in the project (with the expectation that these remain separate). If we relied on the file’s checksum to determine file references, then the references would break once the file contents change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There could still be value to computing a checksum and storing it in &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.uid&lt;/code> files, so that Godot can automatically move the UID file if the source file was moved without its UID file. This is something that should be tackled separately though, as this approach comes with its downsides too.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-not-use-replace-import-files-with-meta-files-and-use-them-for-all-resources-that-have-an-uid">Why not use replace &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.import&lt;/code> files with &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.meta&lt;/code> files and use them for all resources that have an UID?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>While Godot must import many resource types before they can be used in a project, not all types actually need to be imported to be used. Resources that don’t need to be imported to be used don’t have properties that you could set on import, as they are directly loaded by Godot with no remapping system in place. Instead, everything about the file is inferred from the file itself. This approach makes more sense for files that you expect to be able to copy-paste around (or even copy directly from websites), while making sure the file remains functional without needing a separate metadata file. It’s a common workflow from users to copy scripts or shaders from websites such as &lt;a href="https://godotshaders.com/">Godot Shaders&lt;/a> after all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main examples of resources that don’t need to be imported are scripts and shaders, hence the dedicated &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.uid&lt;/code> files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has been suggested that we could still use &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.meta&lt;/code> files for scripts and shaders, and use them to store more information than just UIDs, such as user-defined metadata. For the time being we prefer to focus on the problem at hand (the need of UIDs for better refactoring possibility) and not future-proof things. If we ever change our mind, it would be easy enough to migrate information from &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.uid&lt;/code> files to whichever new container we decide to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-not-use-a-single-centralized-file-to-store-all-the-projects-uids">Why not use a single centralized file to store all the project’s UIDs?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many other programs use a centralized database to store UIDs for all files in the project. While this approach makes for a leaner filesystem, it also has several downsides:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>With a centralized file for all UIDs, the purpose of being able to move scripts or shaders outside of Godot would not be fulfilled. When moving a script outside of Godot, the centralized UID mapping would not be updated, and thus it would lose the connection between the previous path and its UID. For this use case to be supported, the UID needs to be close to the file being moved - either alongside it in a &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.uid&lt;/code> or &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.import&lt;/code> file, or embedded in it (e.g. for &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.tscn&lt;/code> or &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.tres&lt;/code> files).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This file would be subject to frequent merge conflicts in version control systems. For example, if you have two branches that add or edit different scripts/shaders, they would each add their own lines to the UID database file. Both of these branches would add these lines at the same location in the file (probably at the end). However, once you try to merge those two branches together, your version control system wouldn’t be able to know what to keep automatically. This is where a merge conflict occurs.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In contrast, using separate files ensures merge conflicts don’t happen quite as often. If conflicts do arise, they can be resolved by just including the file (or removing it if the source file has also been removed).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Centralizing UID information is problematic for add-ons. For example, if a developer refactors their addon and moves files around, then someone downloads the new version of their addon into an existing project of theirs, references to files in the addon in their project get updated automatically. If UIDs are stored in a centralized fashion, there wouldn’t be a way to do this as the addon’s UIDs wouldn’t be stored in the addon. This would result in UID references breaking.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>While using separate UID files is not perfect by any means, we felt it was a better compromise for Godot’s design and to ensure version control remains as seamless as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-not-embed-the-uid-directly-in-the-scripts-as-a-comment-or-annotation">Why not embed the UID directly in the scripts as a comment or annotation?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We evaluated it, but we saw a lot of pushback against having this kind of magic string injected as a comment or annotation in all script files, as testers found it to be quite disruptive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the technical side, there are also implementation hurdles. All scripting languages supported by Godot (including community bindings via GDExtension) would need to implement this kind of magic comment or annotation (if they have such a concept) with an appropriate syntax. The Godot editor would need to know how to extract these UIDs from all types of scripts in an efficient manner (without having to parse it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, external IDEs and tools may not play nice with such Godot-specific comments or annotations in various scripting languages, and if Godot-specific plugins want to implement UID support, they would also need to manually implement how to extract the UIDs from the scripts in an efficient manner (as opposed to just reading a file with a predictable name).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, it’s not only scripts and shaders that need UIDs, but all resources. While most other builtin resource types can store UID information as described above, this system is also relevant for custom resource formats that users can implement. Having &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.uid&lt;/code> files generated for such resources makes the system work out of the box.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-happens-if-i-dont-commit-uid-files-to-version-control">What happens if I don’t commit &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.uid&lt;/code> files to version control?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you forget to commit &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.uid&lt;/code> files to version control, the project will still work locally. However, as soon as you clone the project on another device, the UID references will break. Godot will still be able to resolve them if the paths haven’t changed (since paths are also saved as a fallback), but a warning will be printed for every resource where a path fallback had to be used to infer the reference. This behavior should not be relied upon intentionally, as it is possible for two resources to be swapped around without either of their paths changing. This can occur if the path of one of the resources was changed to be identical to another resource that was relocated elsewhere.&lt;/p>

The quality of all releases is the same. The only difference is the length of support. LTS releases are supported for 3 years, while STS releases are supported for 18 months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the release of Godot 4.0, we moved our C# packages from targeting Mono to .NET 6. This version of .NET was released on November 8, 2021 and ended support on November 12, 2024.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With .NET 6 ending support, Godot C# packages in 4.4 will target the current LTS release, .NET 8.

&lt;h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-users">What does this mean for users?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Starting with Godot 4.4, your project will need to target .NET 8 or newer, otherwise it will be incompatible with the new &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GodotSharp&lt;/code> packages. You will still be able to use other libraries that target older .NET versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Existing projects will be automatically upgraded to target &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">net8.0&lt;/code> when they are opened with Godot 4.4. If your project already targets .NET 8 or newer, nothing will change. This was implemented in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100195">GH-100195&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-took-so-long">What took so long?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The version of .NET that a library targets becomes the minimum required version for consumers of that library. That is, if the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GodotSharp&lt;/code> package targets &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">net7.0&lt;/code>, your game project needs to target &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">net7.0&lt;/code> or newer. We didn’t want to force our users to upgrade to a non-LTS release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When .NET 8 was released in November 2023, it would’ve been a good time to bump the target version in Godot C# packages, since .NET 8 is an LTS release. Unfortunately, there were some breaking changes in .NET 7&lt;sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> that prevented us from upgrading, and making the required changes took us longer than we hoped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, users could always use the latest version of .NET in their projects. Up until now, .NET 6 has been the minimum required version, but newer versions have always been supported from day one (even the pre-releases&lt;sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>). In 4.4, the new minimum is now .NET 8, but as always, your projects can target the recent STS release .NET 9 and any newer version that is released in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Libraries tend to stay on older versions of .NET to support as many consumers as possible. But upgrading to the latest version of .NET brings benefits that we want to take advantage of.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-about-older-godot-releases">What about older Godot releases?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We encourage users to upgrade to the latest version of Godot. We work hard to prevent breaking compatibility, to ensure you can safely upgrade to new versions of Godot when they are released. Please, make sure to test the pre-releases and let us know if you find some bugs so we can fix them before the stable release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Older versions of Godot will keep targeting .NET 6; we won’t change the target version in patch updates, since that would be a big breaking change. If you still need to target .NET 6, you can stay on an older version of Godot, but we strongly encourage you to update to benefit from all the fixes and improvements included in the latest version of Godot and the .NET runtime.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-about-future-net-releases">What about future .NET releases?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Godot always supports the latest .NET version. The version targeted by Godot’s C# packages is only the minimum version that your project can target, but you are always free to target a newer .NET version. To target the latest .NET 9 release in your project, you just need to install the latest version of the .NET SDK and change the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TargetFramework&lt;/code> property in your &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.csproj&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>

As our team winds down for the holiday season, we present you with one last gift before
the new year: our final development build of the year!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After having a few notable regressions in dev 6, we intended to do a quick turnaround for dev 7 with high priority bug
fixes. But we got greedy and ended up making dev 7 another feature-packed new release so you will have plenty of things
to check out while we are on holidays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep in mind that while we try to make sure each dev snapshot is stable enough for general testing, this is by
definition a pre-release piece of software. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as
Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="#downloads">Jump to the &lt;strong>Downloads&lt;/strong> section&lt;/a>, and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also try the &lt;a href="https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.4.dev7/">&lt;strong>Web editor&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/godot-game-engine/7713660705416473/">&lt;strong>XR editor&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, or the &lt;strong>Android editor&lt;/strong> for this release (join the &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers">Android editor testing group&lt;/a> to get access to pre-release builds).&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In case you missed them, see the &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-1/">4.4 dev 1&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-2/">4.4 dev 2&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-3/">4.4 dev 3&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-4/">4.4 dev 4&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-5/">4.4 dev 5&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-6/">4.4 dev 6&lt;/a> release notes for an overview of
some key features which were already in those snapshots, and are therefore still available for testing in dev 7.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are highlights of a few new features in dev 7 that you might find particularly exciting!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="jolt-physics-module">Jolt Physics module&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Ever since its inception in late 2022, &lt;a href="https://github.com/godot-jolt/godot-jolt">godot-jolt&lt;/a> has become the de-facto 3D
physics engine for many of our developers. Much of the history behind why this was the case is documented in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/7308">this
proposal&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://github.com/adamscott">Adam Scott&lt;/a>, but
the main takeaway was a strong push for this tool to be recognized as an official addon. In doing so, users would be
able to find this amazing resource in a way that was promoted by the engine itself; an exciting prospect!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Godot Jolt maintainers, &lt;a href="https://github.com/mihe">Mikael Hermansson&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/jrouwe">Jorrit Rouwe&lt;/a>,
took this idea one step further: integrating the tool as part of the engine &lt;em>directly&lt;/em>. There was already a symbiosis
between their team and the Godot engine, with many features being added to Godot &lt;em>and&lt;/em> Jolt to accommodate both, but the
integration of an official module was no small feat; their pull request
(&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99895">GH-99895&lt;/a>) ended up adding over 500 files and 115 &lt;strong>thousand&lt;/strong> lines
of code! So while this was one of the most rigorously tested PRs relative to the amount of time it’s been up, it’d be
impossible for any team to account for &lt;em>everything&lt;/em> this behemoth introduced, so we eagerly await your feedback (and bug
reports) on one of the most highly-requested features of 4.x.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> At time of writing, this does &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> replace Godot Physics as the default 3D physics engine.
The Jolt Physics integration in Godot is considered experimental, and may change in future releases. It also lacks some features of Godot Physics so isn’t a full drop-in replacement. If your interests/use-case are supported, the
tool can be enabled by changing the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">physics/3d/physics_engine&lt;/code> project setting to &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jolt Physics&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="net-80">.NET 8.0&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/paulloz">Paul Joannon&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/raulsntos">Raul Santos&lt;/a> have put the final pieces in
place for moving both the GodotSharp library and user projects to .NET 8 (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92131">GH-92131&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100195">GH-100195&lt;/a>). All new projects will use .NET 8 by default and
existing projects will automatically update to .NET 8 once opened with this release or any newer 4.4 build.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="improved-scene-tree-editor-performance">Improved Scene Tree editor performance&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The amount of performance boosts that have been crammed in between dev 6 and dev 7 has been staggering. Of note are the
recent improvements to the engine’s core including many optimizations throughout the String class, spearheaded by
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Ivorforce">Ivorforce&lt;/a>. But perhaps the most obvious improvement comes from &lt;a href="https://github.com/hpvb">HP van
Braam&lt;/a> and their modifications to the SceneTree system
(&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99700">GH-99700&lt;/a>). While this will prove beneficial across all projects,
these changes result in especially complex scenes having a tenfold performance in the editor when moving or renaming
nodes in the SceneTree.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="documentation-tooltips">Documentation tooltips&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/dalexeev">Danil Alexeev&lt;/a> the GDScript code editor will now display a tooltip containing
information about functions, variables, classes, etc. when you hover over them, including the documentation you have
written using our documentation system (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/91060">GH-91060&lt;/a>). This makes using
the integrated documentation system even more powerful as you no longer have to bounce between the code editor and the
related docs to quickly get information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/storage/blog/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-7/documentation-tooltip.webp" alt="Documentation tooltip" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="baked-shadowmasks-for-lightmaps">Baked shadowmasks for lightmaps&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Until now, you have always had to choose between fully baked or fully dynamic shadows when using LightmapGI. However,
sometimes you want to have dynamic shadows up close where detail matters, but use static shadows in the distance where a
low resolution is acceptable. Finally it is possible thanks to the hard work of
&lt;a href="https://github.com/BlueCube3310">BlueCube3310&lt;/a> in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85653">GH-85653&lt;/a>. You can
now enable shadow masks while baking your LightmapGI to combine dynamic and static shadows for the best quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, this allows you to drastically shorten the range of your dynamic shadows which is a very important
optimization, especially for mobile devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This feature is still experimental and it will change in response to feedback, so please test it out and let us know
what you think!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/storage/blog/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-7/shadowmask.webp" alt="Baked Lightmap" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="updated-toolchains-for-official-builds">Updated toolchains for official builds&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We updated some of the toolchains we use for official builds in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/build-containers/pull/150">build-containers#150&lt;/a>,
notably macOS and iOS SDKs from Xcode 16.2, and MinGW 12.0.0 with GCC 14.2.1 for Windows builds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Toolchains for Linux, Android, and Web are still the same versions as for Godot 4.3.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="and-more">And more!&lt;/h3>

Today, we want to put a spotlight on a number of community projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="godot-xr-community-game-jams">Godot XR community Game Jams&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To showcase the engine capabilities and the ingenuity of the Godot XR community, game jams are now being organized twice a year.
It’s a fun way for participants to get introduced to Godot’s XR capabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="godot-xr-game-jam-1">Godot XR Game Jam #1&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam">first Godot XR Game Jam&lt;/a> was held from 1 December until 4 December 2023.
The theme of this game jam was Vapor.
We saw both many new faces and long-time community members join, and had a total of 17 entries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The #1 spot went to &lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam/rate/2402526">Cloud Shepherd&lt;/a> which won 3 out of 6 categories, including “Originality”, “User experience”, and “Audio”.
In this entry, you herd sheep on clouds in the sky by using fans to create breezes that blow the sheep to their destinations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The #2 spot was taken by &lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam/rate/2402404">Super Steam Hands&lt;/a> which won 2 out of 6 categories (“Fun factor” and “Theme incorporation”).
Don’t let the thumbnail of this entry fool you. It’s a great game where you can feel like Iron Man by using jets of steam to parkour around a level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The #3 spot went to &lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam/rate/2400974">Pipe Stream&lt;/a> which ranked the best in the “Haptics” category.
It’s a great little puzzle game where you need to chip away a path for vapor to reach a target. Very challenging!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were far more great entries, so be sure to &lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam/entries">check out the jam page for more&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="godot-xr-game-jam-2">Godot XR Game Jam #2&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam-july-2024">second Godot XR Game Jam&lt;/a> was held from 8 July until 15 July 2024.
We decided to give participants a full week to complete their game.
The theme this jam was Relaxation. There were a total of 26 entries and this time we scored them on the average points in all categories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The #1 spot went to &lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam-july-2024/rate/2821459">Who’s a good boy&lt;/a> with 4.042 points.
This cute little game has you play fetch with a dog in a park.
It features some excellent interactions both from the player’s and dog’s points of view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The #2 spot went to &lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam-july-2024/rate/2830514">Constellation Coach VR&lt;/a> with 3.974 points.
This game has you find constellations in the night sky by holding up a picture of the constellation and aligning it with the relevant stars.
Excellent haptic feedback lets you know when you’ve gotten close, and successfully aligning the constellation lights it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The #3 spot went to &lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam-july-2024/rate/2830121">Summer Pottery VR&lt;/a> with 3.938 points.
This game lets you do some clay pottery sculpting.
It’s a great and very well-executed use of physically interacting with the clay to shape and paint your creation.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="godot-xr-game-jam-3">Godot XR Game Jam #3&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The 3rd game jam will be held in the week starting 10 February 2025. &lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam-feb-2025">You can read all about it and sign up here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="universal-godot-vr-plugin">Universal Godot VR plugin&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Inspired by the Universal Unreal Engine VR Mod, community member TeddyBear082 has created a mod to inject VR capabilities into existing 3D games made with Godot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TeddyBear082 previously made a name for himself with the excellent VR port of the popular game Cruelty Squad and has used the knowledge gained with that and similar projects to create a more universal mod.&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hb9BDcCZHCY?si=Zr2Jw3MV7cY00yEE" title="UGVR Demo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;p>You can find the plugin &lt;a href="https://github.com/teddybear082/UGVR">on teddybear082’s GitHub profile&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="body-tracking-and-motion-capture-plugins">Body tracking and motion capture plugins&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Core contributor Malcolm Nixon has created various plugins for Godot that use the new body tracking feature to make tracking data available from various sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He has support for Rokoko, Axis Studio and Movella.
He also has a plugin for VMC (Virtual Motion Capture), which is a standard used by a number of motion capture systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find the plugins &lt;a href="https://github.com/Malcolmnixon?tab=repositories">on his GitHub profile&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="meta-platform-plugin">Meta platform plugin&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Community member Decacis has released a few of his games on the Meta Horizon store and implemented part of the Meta platform SDK in support of this.
He has implemented support for things like in-app purchases, leaderboard, challenges, and much much more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The plugin he created is open source and can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/decacis/godot_oculus_platform">on his GitHub profile&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="godot-xr-tools">Godot XR Tools&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We’ve showcased XR Tools before, but with version 4.4 of the plugin nearly ready for release, it’s worth quickly looking at what’s coming.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Improved support for Godot 4.2+ features such as pass through logic with both OpenXR and WebXR.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New objects to make games suitable for both VR and non-VR use.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A new gaze interaction component for controller-less experiences.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Various improvements to snap points.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improvements to hands interacting with physics.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YWdcc6r9w3E?si=BimitXSjjVQxcLrO" title="Godot XR tools demo for GodotCon 2024" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;h2 id="godot-arcore-support">Godot ARCore support&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>ARCore support in Godot has been a long time coming.
From an early working prototype in Godot 3, to moving this into a community maintained plugin, there have been plenty of hurdles along the way. Thanks to the persistance of Patrick Exner, Luca Junge, and Chambefort Maxime, we have nearly reached the finish line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Supporting changes were recently merged into the master branch of Godot and you can find the plugin itself &lt;a href="https://github.com/GodotVR/godot_arcore">on the plugin’s GitHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description><category>News</category><guid>https://godotengine.org/article/godot-xr-community-nov-2024/</guid><dc:creator>Bastiaan Olij</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><image>https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/covers/december-2024-update-godot-xr-community.webp</image></item><item><title>Meet the creator behind the Godot Game Awards</title><link>https://godotengine.org/article/godot-game-awards-stayathomedev/</link><summary>StayAtHomeDev has been sharing his passion on YouTube for over two years and now he's running the awards.</summary><description>&lt;h2 id="update-the-godot-game-awards-winners-have-been-announced-you-can-watch-the-video-here">Update: The Godot Game Awards winners have been announced! You can watch the video &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUzAHrpjwl4">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/h2>
&lt;hr />
&lt;p>If you’ve watched Godot-related content on YouTube, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@stayathomedev">StayAtHomeDev&lt;/a> needs no introduction. He’s been sharing his passion for game development and the Godot Engine through his channel. As the creator of the popular “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEHvj4yeNfeHArSU6U2a715ssJYYCnKCg">This Week in Godot&lt;/a>” series, and the Godot Game Awards, he’s helped showcase the amazing work of the Godot community. We had the chance to talk with him about his journey, what inspired the awards, and his efforts to support the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-inspired-you-to-create-the-godot-game-awards-and-how-long-has-it-been-running">What inspired you to create the Godot Game Awards, and how long has it been running?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I started the “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEHvj4yeNfeHArSU6U2a715ssJYYCnKCg">This Week in Godot&lt;/a>” series over two years ago on my channel. At first it started as a compilation of cool projects or games I found throughout each week. About 7-8 videos in, I thought it would be cool if people could vote for their favorite each week and the engagement exploded. People would comment every week and eventually I compiled every winner into a final vote for the “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_3N_nL9gIM">Best Godot Project of the Year&lt;/a>” in 2023.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year I wanted to expand that into multiple categories, highlighting certain achievements like art design and music, and give attention to other things like plugins, tutorials, even devlogs. From that came the Godot Game Awards, a compilation of the best Godot-based games, plugins, and projects as voted by viewers on my channel.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-can-people-get-involved-in-this-years-edition">How can people get involved in this year’s edition?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>People can get involved from now until December 15th by voting on the 20+ different categories with an official 2024 🗳️ &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/Q4yYy82neZcKA3Ny6">Godot Game Awards Ballot&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The winners will be announced in a premiere video on December 28th at 2:00pm EST on my channel so that everyone can watch together and help support the great work by these developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tell-us-about-your-youtube-channelwhat-kind-of-content-do-you-focus-on-and-what-motivated-you-to-start-creating-videos">Tell us about your YouTube channel—what kind of content do you focus on, and what motivated you to start creating videos?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I started &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@stayathomedev">StayAtHomeDev&lt;/a> over two years ago to share my passion for creating through game development. At the time, I had a potential job offer to be the Web Coordinator for a professional football team in the US. But I had just been given a grant by Meta for some VR development work with their Oculus Quest 2 headset so I used that to launch the channel. It really was an exercise to create independent income so I could stay at home with my kids. That was a lifestyle choice I knew I wanted to make for them, so I took a shot at YouTube.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m very interested in sharing knowledge so the channel has had an element of teaching with tutorials or game development concept videos. With the “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEHvj4yeNfeHArSU6U2a715ssJYYCnKCg">This Week in Godot&lt;/a>” series, the channel started to steer more towards enriching the Godot community and showcasing what people were creating with the engine. Now, it’s a mix of tutorials, QAs about general game development topics, and the newest format, interviews. I am actually most excited about the interview videos because they really give a chance for viewers to peek into real game dev life with stories and advice from developers actively breaking through the industry or those who are already successful, and of course doing it with the Godot Engine.&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8nsJw89FG_A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9; height: auto;">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;h3 id="how-did-you-discover-godot-when-did-you-start-using-it-do-you-have-prior-experience-with-other-game-engines">How did you discover Godot? When did you start using it? Do you have prior experience with other game engines?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you look at the earliest videos on the channel, you’ll notice they were all focused on the Unreal Engine. I actually worked within Unreal first. Long ago…like long ago…I started making little games with an engine called 3D GameStudio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I started the channel, I knew of Godot (which I thought was called GoDot) but never tried it. After spending more time on YouTube and lurking around other game dev content, Godot kept popping up, so I took it for a test drive. I ended up making a video about it which went “viral” for a small channel while my first kid was being born. There was clearly a lot of interest in the engine so I kept playing around with it and fell in love. Not only with how streamlined it felt but also because it was open source and had such a strong sense of community and pride. I decided I wanted to help support that with the channel.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-someone-starting-out-as-a-game-developer-or-content-creator-in-the-godot-community">What advice would you give to someone starting out as a game developer or content creator in the Godot community?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I would say the WORST thing you can do is stop yourself before you even try. Game development and content creation are both difficult. They are also largely self-motivated so telling yourself you can’t do them means you likely won’t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The BEST thing you can do is just try. If you are interested in making games, download the engine and try. You are going to hit walls and fail at a number of things but that’s part of the learning process. The information and tools are out there, you just need to start the climb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In more applicable terms…start small, remake Pong or level 1 of Mario Bros. If something seems too difficult to understand, break it into smaller pieces. Don’t try to make an entire 2D platformer controller, make it move left and right first. And don’t think you’re going to sell your first game and make tons of money. You’ll put too much pressure on yourself and it won’t be fun anymore, you’ll get frustrated, and you’ll quit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For content creation, it’s a marathon so the most important thing is don’t worry about the views. Make content that you want to make. If a video gets more views than normal, analyze why, and do it again with a small change. YouTube is sort of a constantly moving target and you won’t get a good idea of your style, your interest, or what people want to watch for a while. And even then, those things can always change. Consistency is the important variable…keep doing it and consistently try to get better. Better sound, better speaking, better editing, better pacing, better thumbnails, better topics, better storytelling. There is always something you can improve. If you create videos consistently and improve with every video, you’ll get to where you want to go and build a ton of new skills along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C-sJarU469Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9; height: auto;">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;h3 id="do-you-plan-to-continue-organizing-the-godot-game-awards-in-the-future">Do you plan to continue organizing the Godot Game Awards in the future?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Absolutely! There have already been nearly 1000 ballots submitted, which is crazy to me. People comment how they enjoy finding new Godot projects every week with the weekly video series and tell me that they feel inspired to make something themselves. That is the best thing I could hope for, that people feel inspired to create. I’m also a music therapist so I have seen the effect creativity and expression can have on a person’s well-being. To me, games are an art form and within that lies the ability to create powerful feelings in other people through interactive play. If one person continues to be inspired by the games showcased in the awards, then I’ll keep making the videos.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In case you missed them, see the &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-1/">4.4 dev 1&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-2/">4.4 dev 2&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-3/">4.4 dev 3&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-4/">4.4 dev 4&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-5/">4.4 dev 5&lt;/a> release notes for an overview of
some key features which were already in those snapshots, and are therefore still available for testing in dev 6.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are highlights of a few new features in dev 6 that you might find particularly exciting!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="camera3d-preview-in-inspector">Camera3D preview in inspector&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Previously, adjusting the view of a &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Camera3D&lt;/code> in a scene could be a chore to handle. It required activating the camera you wanted to preview, and then reverting it back if it wasn’t the main camera. You could pin a preview of a camera in a dedicated viewport, but that meant reducing the real-estate of your main viewport.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, with &lt;a href="https://github.com/timothyqiu">Haoyu Qiu&lt;/a>’s feature (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90778">GH-90778&lt;/a>), every selected 3D camera shows a preview inside the inspector. No switching cameras needed to preview anymore.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;h3 id="collisionshape3d-debug-color-customization">CollisionShape3D debug color customization&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>3D collision shapes now have parity with their 2D counterparts with the newly added &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">debug_color&lt;/code> and &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">debug_fill&lt;/code> properties, which lets you customize the appearance of debug collision shapes in the editor, or at runtime if “Visible Collision Shapes” is enabled in the Debug menu. Thanks to first-time contributor &lt;a href="https://github.com/BattyBovine">BattyBovine&lt;/a> for implementing this much-requested proposal (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90644">GH-90644&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/storage/blog/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-6/debug-color.webp" alt="Examples of custom debug colors" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="replace-internal-csg-implementation-with-manifold-library">Replace internal CSG implementation with Manifold library&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Godot added support for CSG, or Constructive Solid Geometry, &lt;a href="/article/godot-gets-csg-support/">back in 3.1&lt;/a>. This is a great tool for rapidly prototyping level geometry or even simple props and characters by combining 3D primitives with various boolean operations (union, intersection, subtraction).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our implementation suffered from a number of bugs and stability issues, with no dedicated maintainer to tackle them. Thankfully, a great open source library has been released since then which can be used as a well-maintained replacement for our CSG internals: &lt;a href="https://github.com/elalish">Emmett Lalish&lt;/a>’s &lt;a href="https://github.com/elalish/manifold">Manifold&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/fire">Ernest Lee&lt;/a> did an amazing work implementing Manifold in Godot, with help from Emmett to ensure that the library fits our requirements (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/94321">GH-94321&lt;/a>). As this is a fairly big change to how Godot’s CSG works internally (but with minimal impact on the user API), you might notice differences in your projects using CSG. Please report any change that appears to have a negative impact on your usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="runtime-wav-file-loading">Runtime WAV file loading&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>First-time contributor &lt;a href="https://github.com/what-is-a-git">cherry&lt;/a> implemented the long-requested support for runtime loading of WAV files (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/93831">GH-93831&lt;/a>). This adds parity with OGG Vorbis audio tracks, and will be a welcome addition for users who want to load user-generated content at runtime (including non-game audio applications).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="extend-curve-to-allow-for-domains-outside-of-0-1">Extend Curve to allow for domains outside of &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[0, 1]&lt;/code>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Have you ever wished that you could edit a &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Curve&lt;/code> in a domain that goes beyond the normalized &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[0, 1]&lt;/code> range? &lt;a href="https://github.com/anvilfolk">ocean&lt;/a> finally got their implementation of this feature merged (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/67857">GH-67857&lt;/a>), which should give you greater flexibility in how to map your functions and data to Godot’s ubiquitous Curve resource.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;h3 id="temporary-file-and-directory-utilities">Temporary file and directory utilities&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Tool creators, &lt;a href="https://github.com/adamscott">Adam Scott&lt;/a> cooked a little something that could be interesting for you. A brand new API lets you create and dispose of temporary files. Handy if you need to write content on disk, but without worrying about polluting user data. These temporary files and directories even dispose of themselves after use by default. For more information, see (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/98397">GH-98397&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>

While engine maintainers try their best to ensure that each preview snapshot and release candidate is stable, this is by definition &lt;strong>a pre-release piece of software&lt;/strong>. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.

&lt;h2 id="known-issues">Known issues&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With every release we accept that there are going to be various issues, which have already been reported but haven’t been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+">known bugs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are some known regressions introduced in this snapshot:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Occlusion culling randomly occluding things completely in the open (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/100032">GH-10032&lt;/a>).
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A pull request is already open to fix this in the next dev snapshot (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100060">GH-100060&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Error “Manifold creation from mesh failed” with Plane and Quad shapes, which do not get rendered (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/100014">GH-100014&lt;/a>).
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Planes and Quads cannot be used with CSG, and just seemed to be usable previously. We’ll improve the usability so they cannot be selected for CSGMesh3D. Instead, use MeshInstance3D to place Planes and Quads.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>As a tester, we encourage you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">open bug reports&lt;/a> if you experience issues with this release. Please check the &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">existing issues on GitHub&lt;/a> first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This blog post was originally posted on &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/100000">GH-100000&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It’s been over 10 years now that Godot has been developed in the open, with code contributions from 2,800 users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The total count of people who helped build Godot is actually far greater, as it should include documentation writers, testers, bug reporters, translators, moderators, content creators, users doing community support or talking at events, folks making games that credit Godot visibly, everyone supporting the project financially, and many other types of contributions which I can’t keep enumerating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All these people brought Juan and Ariel’s little-engine-that-could from this:&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>That’s no small achievement, so I encourage all contributors to take a minute to contemplate the progress that we’ve made together over this journey so far!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Amidst the daily churn of fixing issues, reviewing &lt;abbr title="pull requests">PRs&lt;/abbr>, making releases, etc., it’s important to remind ourselves of where we are, and how we got there.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="some-stats-about-godot-usage-on-github">Some stats about Godot usage on GitHub&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Between our usual traditions of either &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10000">making silly jokes&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/30000">sharing some inspiring stats&lt;/a> for round issue numbers, I picked the latter for this 100,000th issue&lt;sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and wanted to look a bit closer at our issue and &lt;abbr title="pull request">PR&lt;/abbr> numbers over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of people coming to Godot’s repository to see over 10,000 open issues and 3,000 open &lt;abbr title="pull requests">PRs&lt;/abbr> might rightfully wonder whether this is normal, or a sign of a maintenance issue.
I will make the case that it is a bit of both :)&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="issues">Issues&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/storage/blog/beyond-100000-you-re-breathtaking/issue-history.webp" alt="Graph showing issue count over time" />&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="small text-center">
&lt;p>&lt;em>Visualization from OSS Insight showing issue count over time, &lt;a href="https://ossinsight.io/analyze/godotengine/godot#issue-history">see the interactive version&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The two accumulated curves show the total number of issues created over the lifetime of the repository (topmost curve), and the subset of those which have been closed (as fixed or invalid). The difference between the two curves represents the number of issues still open at a given point in time - currently exactly 11,000, out of 53,648 issues total, so roughly 20%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a fairly normal percentage of yet-unresolved issues in software projects of this scale, but it can definitely be better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I annotated the graph with some key events of Godot’s development which match peaks in either reported bugs (usually at the start of a beta phase, or shortly after a stable release), or closed issues (when we do a “spring cleaning” going through old issues to check if they are still reproducible in a newly released Godot version). You can see notably two big peaks of closed issues around the 3.2 release, when we had a coordinated effort from maintainers to go through the whole backlog and ask reporters to confirm whether their issues were still valid, or had been fixed. This reduced the percentage of open issues from 29% to 19%, and it’s been mostly stable since, with minor fluctuations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are preparing a new “spring cleaning” to properly reassess a lot of the old issues which have been opened before the 4.0 release, or in the early days of 4.0 or 4.1, and may no longer be relevant nowadays with 4.3 and soon 4.4 beta.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the volume of issues keeps increasing steadily, but the number of active bug triagers doesn’t really grow as fast, we are working on improving and documenting our workflows so that we can:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Onboard new volunteers to help triage new and old issues;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spread the workload and be more consistent with our issue triage;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be confident that while doing so, we do increase the &lt;em>quality&lt;/em> of our open issues, which isn’t something that can be easily tracked in numbers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We will share more details here and on the Godot blog when this process is ready to welcome new volunteers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the meantime, you can already do some simple things which help greatly the existing bug triage team:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20author%3A%40me">&lt;strong>Regularly re-assess your own issues&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> (you can bookmark that URL). Make sure that they are reproducible in the latest stable release and dev snapshots, and that there is a minimal reproduction project that contributors can use to reproduce and fix the issue. If your issue is no longer relevant, please close it with a comment explaining why.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Feel free to apply the same process to other people’s issues that you stumble upon, especially if their last update was a long time ago. In this case you can’t close issues yourself, but you can suggest it by commenting that the issue is no longer reproducible in the version you tested. Bug triagers will get a notification and can double check.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="pull-requests">Pull Requests&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/storage/blog/beyond-100000-you-re-breathtaking/pull-request-history.webp" alt="Graph showing pull request count over time" />&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="small text-center">
&lt;p>&lt;em>Visualization from OSS Insight showing pull request count over time, &lt;a href="https://ossinsight.io/analyze/godotengine/godot#pr-history">see the interactive version&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I didn’t annotate this one, but a few takeaways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Godot gets almost the same number of new pull requests per month as new issues, roughly 600 of each per month (that’s 20 &lt;abbr title="pull requests">PRs&lt;/abbr> and 20 issues per day).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;abbr title="pull request">PR&lt;/abbr> volume increased a lot over the lifetime of the project to culminate at over 700 &lt;abbr title="pull requests">PRs&lt;/abbr> per month at the end of the 4.0 development. Since then, as the Godot userbase grew a lot and we are more careful with compatibility and API design, reviews can take a bit longer and the total monthly volume seems to have plateaued around 500-600. That’s still plenty enough for a fairly small group of reviewers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Someone should plot this data with relative percentages, but it seems like the size/complexity of pull requests is slightly increasing recently. Whether that trend gets confirmed or not, I can attest that reviewing 600 &lt;abbr title="pull requests">PRs&lt;/abbr> per month is hard, and that we need more help for interested contributors and users to both test and review the &lt;abbr title="pull requests">PRs&lt;/abbr> that get opened on a daily basis.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr />
&lt;p>That’s all for now, I was already way too long and verbose while drafting this at the last minute to (try to) snatch the 100,000th issue number ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aside from showing some cool numbers, I mostly want to convey that we are well aware that we have a significant backlog, though it’s not as dire as it might look from the outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To deal with it, we need better triage and review processes (which we are designing now), more volunteers involved in these processes, but also importantly &lt;a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">&lt;strong>more funding&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. Volunteer contributors do a ton of work, but many critical parts of the workflow depend on a few paid contractors, and we need to grow that group to better manage the increasing scale of the project.&lt;/p>

&lt;li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
&lt;p>I’ll make a quick note that 100,000 is the combined number of issues and &lt;abbr title="pull requests">PRs&lt;/abbr>, which share the same index system on GitHub.&lt;br />&lt;br />At the time of writing, we’ve actually had 53,648 issues and 45,213 &lt;abbr title="pull requests">PRs&lt;/abbr> created. Astute minds will notice that the sum is not 100,000; the difference comes from spam issues or &lt;abbr title="pull requests">PRs&lt;/abbr> which have been deleted by GitHub. &lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#8617;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

Here’s what we’ve been up to.</summary><description>&lt;p>The Foundation has been working on a number of things behind the scenes that are important for the organization and for
the Godot ecosystem more broadly. We wanted to take the chance to highlight a few of them in this post.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-policies-and-procedures">Key policies and procedures&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Foundation was formed in August 2022, but we only began operating in a full capacity in July 2023. We initially
adopted the &lt;a href="https://sfconservancy.org/projects/policies/">member project policies&lt;/a> of the Software Freedom Conservancy.
Doing so allowed us to operate exactly as we had when we were a member project of the SFC, and maintain very high
standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In September, we adopted a modified version of those policies that is more specific to our organization. You can read the
updated version on the &lt;a href="https://godot.foundation/policies-and-procedures/key-policies">Godot Foundation website&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are very happy with the policies and we hope you are too. They hold us to a very high standard and ensure that the
Foundation will always operate in a way that supports Godot.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="contractors">Contractors&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Foundation currently has 10 contractors working on the engine directly (6 full time, 4 part time) and 3 contractors
working on administration and infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the most contractors we have had at once, and even so, we feel understaffed as there is always more
work that needs to be done than we can do. Accordingly, we would like to continue hiring once funding allows for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="upcoming-projects">Upcoming projects&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Foundation is working on 4 major projects in addition to working on Godot itself:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>An official asset store&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An official job board on the Godot website&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A public project priorities page&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A public trademark policy&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="asset-store">Asset store&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We have been working towards an initial version of the asset store for a while now. It has taken us some time to get the legal aspects into place and a design agreed upon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We expect to have an early access version of the site up and running this month and we will begin inviting testers to help us polish it and get it ready for a full release sometime in 2025.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="job-board">Job board&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We aim to have a place for people to post that are looking to hire Godot developers to add to their game team or Godot
contributors to fix high priority bugs that may be impacting your team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to a job board, we will be curating a list of service providers who have shown that they offer services in
the Godot ecosystem to make it easy to find someone to contract with if you need support or any other services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Much of the foundational work for this has been finished, but it will likely be released after the asset store so we can
focus our efforts more on that first.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="project-priorities">Project priorities&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Soon we will be adding a project priorities page to our website to give the community more clarity on the direction of
development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have avoided providing a roadmap as we don’t want to promise more than we can deliver, or put too much pressure on
volunteer contributors. However, the Godot Project maintainers have agreed that it is time to at least write down what
the largest tasks are that we are working towards. This won’t be like a traditional roadmap where we have specific tasks
with expected dates. However, we believe it will answer a lot of questions that the community has about the future of
the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="trademark-policy">Trademark policy&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We registered the Godot trademark and the Godot logo trademark while still a member project of the SFC. Last year, the
SFC granted the Godot Foundation ownership over the trademarks. Now we need to have a public policy that says how and
when others can use the trademarks to protect them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are working with our lawyers to craft a policy that is fair to existing users, as permissive as possible, and still

&lt;h2 id="the-foundations-role-in-the-project">The Foundation’s role in the project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We also wanted to take this chance to muse about the Foundation’s role in the project. In particular, we want to
contrast the size of the Foundation with the size of the Godot project contributor pool. As explained above, the
Foundation currently hires 13 contractors to work on Godot, while the total number of contributors to Godot is over
2,500 (the 4.3 release alone had over 500 contributors)! This large group of contributors is the reason why Godot is
able to improve so quickly and do so much for a fraction of the funding that the other large engines have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Foundation (meaning the Board of Directors and the people hired by the Foundation) does not determine the priorities
of the project in a top-down way. In other words, the Foundation does not dictate to individual volunteers what they
should work on. Instead, it influences the project implicitly by making hiring decisions and hiring people for specific
tasks that aren’t being done by the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, it is the Godot community that deserves the most credit for the growth and development of Godot. While we
hope to see the Foundation grow and take on a stronger role in the project, it should be seen as a central pillar of the
project that volunteers can rally around. Donating to the Foundation is one avenue to contribute, but there are many
more and Godot needs contribution in all areas in order to continue growing at this pace. Please consider contributing
however you are able!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Godot is a non-profit, open source game engine developed by hundreds of contributors in their free time, as well as a handful of part or full-time developers hired thanks to &lt;a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">generous donations from the Godot community&lt;/a>. A big thank you to everyone who has contributed &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/AUTHORS.md">their time&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/DONORS.md">their financial support&lt;/a> to the project!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’d like to support the project financially and help us secure our future hires, you can do so using the &lt;a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">Godot Development Fund&lt;/a> platform managed by &lt;a href="https://godot.foundation/">Godot Foundation&lt;/a>. There are also several &lt;a href="/donate">alternative ways to donate&lt;/a> which you may find more suitable.&lt;/p></description><category>News</category><guid>https://godotengine.org/article/godot-foundation-update-dec-2024/</guid><dc:creator>Godot Foundation</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><image>https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/covers/godot-foundation-update-2024.webp</image></item></channel></rss>
